House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

I don't watch Game of Thrones so I really have no clue how to even start dreaming about Ned Stark.  I hear Stark and I think about the Avengers and the rich super genious man that lives in Stark tower. That sounds like a better life than living in wherever / whatever Winterfell is.
